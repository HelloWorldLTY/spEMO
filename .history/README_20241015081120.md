# spEMO
This is the official code repo for the paper: spEMO: Exploring the Capacity of Foundation Models for Analyzing Spatial Multi-Omic Data.

## Installation

To install spEMO, considering to install python, [torch](https://pytorch.org/) and scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) with latest version, and then prepare environment for pathology foundation models:

```
pip install timm
pip install 'transformers[torch]'
```

And then prepare environment for large language model:

```
pip install openai
```

And then prepare environment for analyzing spatial transcriptomics:

```
pip install scanpy
pip install squidpy
```

If you meet error while loading the pickle files, please consider to downgrade the version of package (anndata)[https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/].

Finally, prepare the environment for evaluation:

```
pip install scib-metrics
```
